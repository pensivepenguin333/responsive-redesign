                    OVERVIEW
                </span></h3>
                <div class="section-body">
                    <p>
                        I stumbled upon Elke's Market Cafe, a local cafe in 
                        Allen, TX that provides food, market, and catering 
                        services. Looking at their website linked 
                        <a href="https://www.elkesmarketcafe.com/">
                            here</a>, I felt as though the formatting was
                        not intuitive, and it was overall a very busy website.
                        Thus, I decided to focus on improving the clarity 
                        of the home page to improve its <span>learnability</span>, 
                        <span>memorability</span>, and <span>efficiency</span>
                        for users.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3><span>
                    PROBLEMS

                <div class="section-body">
                    <p>
                        Focusing on the <span>usability concepts</span>
                        discussed in class 
                        (learnability, memorability, and efficiency)
                        to drive this redesign, I came up with the following 
                        key issues in the original website:

                        <div class="annotations">
                            <img src='./orig-annotated.png' />
                        </div>

                        <span>Learnability:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The user first sees a massive logo, 
                                navigation bar, and a photo of food with the 
                                text “fresh;” without scrolling quite a bit, 
                                the user doesn't immediately know what the site 
                                entails <span>(1)</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>The navigation bar is a bit cluttered with 8 
                                categories, so it's difficult to find which 
                                option you want without reading through them 
                                all; it's not as simple as just a glance <span>(2)</span>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>“Wine Club" and "Events/Blog” could be 
                                        grouped together
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The “Visit” tab could be renamed as 
                                        “Feedback,” since “Visit” seems to 
                                        imply it has to do with the cafe's 
                                        location, but it's actually a place to 
                                        submit questions and comments
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>There's a random “Log in” button in the bottom 
                                right corner of the webpage; not only is it 
                                easy to miss, but it also doesn't seem that 
                                relevant, as it's not clear on the website what 
                                purpose logging in serves (plus you can't make 
                                an account anywhere) <span>(3)</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>The intent of the home page is not clear, and 
                                it feels very chaotic with so much information 
                                (a description of the place, menu items, a wine 
                                club, etc) <span>(4)</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <span>Memorability:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The pronunciation of the place is a unique 
                                addition, but it's not visually 
                                obvious that it is a pronunciation/definition 
                                (until you read it) <span>(5)</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>The section with exploring the cafe, market, 
                                and catering is also not visually obvious that 
                                these are meant to redirect you to other parts 
                                of the site; they're also visually overwhelming 
                                with how large they are <span>(6)</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <span>Efficiency:</span>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The headers of the page are not necessarily the 
                                largest font size on the page (ie, the random 
                                menu items are much larger), making it 
                                difficult to instantly know when you've 
                                encountered a desired section and should stop 
                                scrolling <span>(7)</span>
                            </li>
                            <li>There are a lot of excessively large images, 
                                which requires the user to scroll quite a bit 
                                before encountering a different section 
                                <span>(8)</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WebAIM WAVE</a>, 
                        I discovered that the web page also had a few 
                        <span>accessibility</span> issues:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A lot of the text throughout the page has a 
                                “very low contrast between text and background 
                                colors” — I agree that some of the color 
                                choices are not the most ideal, specifically 
                                the orange text being used to highlight the 
                                special menu items
                                <ul>
                                    <li> The section headers also have this 
                                        issue; especially with the font being 
                                        as small as it is, it is not 
                                        immediately legible 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The “Home” link is redundant, as it goes to the 
                                same URL as clicking on the logo — I agree with 
                                this, as it is quite common for the logo of a 
                                site to redirect the user to the home page, so 
                                that is built into the user's conceptual model, 
                                making the “Home” tab a bit unnecessary
                            </li>
                            <li>There are multiple images missing alternative text</li>
                            <li>There is an empty link (“link contains no text”) 
                                near their “Wedding and Party” icons; the user 
                                may get redirected to a different page by 
                                clicking on a white area of the page 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3><span>

                    <p>
                        Based on the problems outlined in the previous section,
                        I created 3 different low-fidelity wireframes for a 
                        <span>desktop</span>, <span>tablet</span>, and 
                        <span>mobile</span> screen size. Each number 
                        has a corresponding problem from the previous section 
                        that my redesign fixes:
                        <div class="lofi">
                            <img src='./lofi.png' />
                        </div>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I drastically minimized the <span>amount of 
                                space the logo and navigation bar took up</span> 
                                and also <span>removed the "fresh" photo</span>, 
                                so the user would be able to see more of the 
                                page's introduction as soon as they are on the page
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I reduced the <span>number of categories in the
                                navigation bar</span> from 8 to 6, by removing 
                                the "Home" tab (which can be accessed through 
                                the logo) and combining the "Wine Club" and 
                                "Events/Blog" tab; I also <span>renamed</span> the "Visit"
                                tab as "Feedback," since it was more in line
                                with the content of that page; this makes 
                                utilizing the navigation bar much clearer and 
                                simpler
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I removed the <span>awkwardly placed "Log in"</span>
                                button, as it was not serving a purpose for the 
                                users in the original design
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I simplified the <span>content of the page</span> 
                                to include the original design's key points (the 
                                place's description and the 3 main categories 
                                they have to offer: cafe, market, catering); 
                                this will help the user to better compartmentalize 
                                what Elke's Market Cafe entails
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I added a <span>volume/speaker icon</span> beside 
                                the definition of Elke's to give the user a visual
                                cue that this section will define and introduce
                                the place; the format is also very similar to 
                                the definitions that appear in Google, which 
                                may be familiar to many users
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I included an <span>image behind the 3 different 
                                categories</span> (cafe, market, catering) to 
                                visually indicate to the user what clicking on 
                                them will take them to, as the photos will be 
                                related to the text on top of them
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I increased the <span>size of the main headers</span> 
                                to highlight to the user what the key sections 
                                of the page are
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I removed a lot of the <span>photos on the 
                                original page</span>, as they didn't feel 
                                purposeful, took up a lot of space, and weren't 
                                cohesive with each other; by doing so, the user 
                                will have an easier time scrolling through the page
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>
                        I created 3 high-fidelity prototypes based on the

                        guide from the previous section. The <span>desktop</span>

                                to add space between them, but it is <span>0</span> for 
                                the the <span>logo</span> and the <span>rightmost

                                the <span>max width</span> is <span>1500px</span>,

                                <span>width of the screen</span>, so there is 
                                no extra whitespace beside the element

                                they are each <span>300px</span>; done with

                        The <span>mobile</span> prototype is as follows:

                                Extra <span>padding</span> gets added to the 
                                <span>right</span> (<span>80px</span>) of the
                                <span>"Let's Connect"</span> section to 
                                offset the padding on the left once it wraps 
                                onto the next line; all elements in the 
                                footer are <span>vertically centered</span>
                            </li>
